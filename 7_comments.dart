// Comments are nothing but just a simple line of codes or it may be anything that is not goinf to be executed by the compiler or the interpreter
// Whatever is returned inside of the comment section is going to be neglected by the interpreter/compiler
// If a person has a need of explaining code or writing something that must be ignored by the compiler or interpreter is the comment.

// There is only a single method of writing a comment in dart languages

// Inline comments : it is a comment where two forward slashes are written at the beginning of the code to ensure that it is a comment.
// Eg -  this is a inline comment or sometime also referred to as a single line comment.

// There is also a comment which is called as a block of comments or multi line comments but is not conventional for dart language

/*This is a multi line*/
