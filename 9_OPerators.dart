// Dart supports all the operators you'd expect from a modern programming language.
// There are every operators that are available in other programming languages like + , - , / , * , ++, --, %, etc. 
// Lets see with some examples :

void main (){
    var a = 10, b = 2;
    var c = a +b;
    c = a-b;
    c=a%b;
    c = a/b;
    c = a* b;
    c = c++
    c = c--
    c = --a;
    c = --b;

    var a, b;

a = 0;
b = ++a; // Increment a before b gets its value.
assert(a == b); // 1 == 1


  a = 0;
b = a++; // Increment a AFTER b gets its value.
assert(a != b); // 1 != 0


a = 0;
b = --a; // Decrement a before b gets its value.
assert(a == b); // -1 == -1

a = 0;
b = a--; // Decrement a AFTER b gets its value.
assert(a != b); // -1 != 0


}


// COmparison operators : 


var a , b;
a ==b;
a!=b;
a>b;
a<b;
a>=b;
a<=b;

// I have not explained the work of each operator in details, coz if you are here than i am assuming that you must have a knowledge on any other programming langugaes.
// And hence, operators are mostly same in every programming languages

// PS : If you are a newbie into the world of programming and you are here learning Dart as your programming languages, i recommend you to stop and just close your device, take rest and start learning other easier programming langugaes, like python, c etc. (c is bit complex btw).
// I am saying this not to demotivate you, but in future session when we will be dealing with complex dart structures and all those things than at that time many new topics may come and it can make you think like what the heck is this, shitttt!!!!!!!!(Sorry for the language)

// SO please take a basic of other programming languages, and then after you can visit here, it will be very helpful for you.
// So yeah this much for today, tomorrow we will be looking at assignment and logical operators in dart languages

// Thank you! Practice more, Happy coding.
