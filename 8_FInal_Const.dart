// In previous session, we saw that we can define a variable with the use of var keyword in dart
// But today we will be looking at two keyword that are very important to know about whether it is in dart or any other object oriented programming languages like Java, Python, etc
// In place of var we can use keyword like const, and final
// In simple terms, if a variable is defined using these kwywords, then their values can never be changed throughout the code, it becomes a permanent values.

// Eg : const pi = 3.1415, Now the values of the pi cannot be changed

// Const Keyword
