// Print function is used to print anything in dart language.
// a code begins with a main function, it is the main function that dart looks for when executing our code

void main (){ 
   print("Hello Universe")
}

// dont worry abt void and all we'll discuss abt it later on too
// But for now remeber that dart always searches for the main function to execute our code
