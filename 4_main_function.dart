// As told earlier, any dart program should compulsory begin with a main function
// user should define it and it is compulsion or else the code wont work

void main() {
  print('Hello, Dart');
}

// This main function tells the dart what is the starting point of the program 
// It is the entry point of our program
// There must be only one main function in the program, multiple main function must be strictly prohibited
